# ES6 CRPG

An old-school crpg in ES6 and WebGL with Three.js and webpack and npm and so sass and
so many things.

### How to Play

```bash
git clone $THIS_REPO
cd es6-crpg
npm install
webpack-dev-server
```

If that doesn't do it, submit what else you had to do here.

### How to Play (once it's running)

It should be running on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).  Arrow keys to move.  Not
much else to do right now.
